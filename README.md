# FindingDays
The User will provide a list of int as they wish to know how many times that day repeats between the start and end date. 
Write a program (Console App) to find the days and respective date which repeats or falls between the start and end date.

Example of user input :

listOfInt : [1,3,5],
startDate: 2023-03-01,
endDate: 2023-03-25


Hint:
You guys can use the enum, DayOfWeek which represents the int value of days.
In the above sample input data, the 1,3,5 represents the days which are Monday, Wednesday and Friday. 
Now, you guys should find how many time those days will repeat and on which date between the provided start and end date.
